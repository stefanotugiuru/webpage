        <p>I was born in Tropea, a small coastal town in Calabria, where beauty and simplicity shape every story. Growing up surrounded by sea, colors, and connection, I learned early on that curiosity can turn even the smallest thing into something extraordinary. I was the kid who asked “why” a thousand times, driven by imagination, hungry to learn, and eager to create.</p>

More importantly, I was learning to lead with empathy, with structure, and with confidence.

Around the same time, I joined an Erasmus program in Dublin. There, I organized an event for over 50 people I had never met before. That day, under the Irish sky, I realized something clear: I was born to bring people together.</p>

That short but intense experience taught me one of my most valuable lessons: authenticity attracts. Always.</p>
