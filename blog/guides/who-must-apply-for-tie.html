<h2>Who Must Apply for a TIE Card in Spain?</h2>

<p>
Every non-EU/EEA/Swiss citizen who has been authorized to stay in Spain longer than six months must apply for a TIE. This requirement covers a wide range of situations and permit types. Let’s break down who exactly needs to get a TIE, with some practical examples:
</p>

<p>
<strong>Residents with long-term visas or residence permits:</strong>
If you have a visa stamped in your passport for work, studies, family reunification, etc., that is valid for more than 90–180 days, you definitely need a TIE. For example: a work visa (whether as an employee or self-employed), a non-lucrative residence visa, a student visa longer than 6 months, a family reunification visa, or an investor/entrepreneur visa all require you to obtain a TIE shortly after arriving in Spain. The visa is just for entry; the TIE is needed to continue legally residing in Spain.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Non-EU nationals who change their status or extend their stay in Spain:</strong>
Perhaps you initially came on a short-term visa or as a student and later obtained a different residence authorization from within Spain (for instance, a permiso de residencia through marriage, a arraigo (exceptional circumstance) permit, or a modificación from student to work residency). In these cases, once your new authorization is approved, you must apply for a TIE card to go with it. Even if you didn’t leave Spain to get a visa, a newly granted initial residence permit (or renewed permit) triggers the requirement for a fresh TIE.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Long-term and permanent residents:</strong>
If you’ve been granted long-term resident status (residencia de larga duración, usually after 5 years) or long-term EU status, you also get a TIE (these cards typically last 5 years before renewal). Even refugees and protected persons receive a form of TIE – for instance, asylum beneficiaries get a card valid for five years. (Temporary protection for Ukrainians is a special case; they also receive a TIE, and as of early 2025 Spain has automatically extended those cards’ validity until March 2026 to match the protection period.)
</p>

<p>
<strong>Family members of EU citizens (non-EU family):</strong>
If you are a non-EU family member of an EU/EEA citizen residing in Spain, you won’t get a regular TIE but rather a “Tarjeta de Residencia de Familiar de Comunitario”. That card is very similar to a TIE (biometric card) and the process to obtain it is also within one month of entry/approval. So while the regime is different, in practice you are also applying for a residence card very much like the TIE. (EU citizens themselves do not get TIEs; they register and get a green certificate, but their non-EU spouses or dependents get a card).
</p>

<p>
<strong>UK citizens (Brexit):</strong>
Post-Brexit, Britons moving to Spain fall under the non-EU rules, so they need TIEs like any other third-country nationals. Those who were already resident before 2021 had the option to exchange their old EU residence document for the new TIE. In short, if you’re British and now have a Spanish residency permit, you either have or should get a TIE.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Special categories:</strong>
Holders of diplomatic cards or other accreditation (like staff of international organizations) might not need a TIE through Extranjería, but these are rare exceptions. Virtually all other non-EU residents will go through the TIE process.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, who doesn’t need a TIE? If you’re staying in Spain short-term (90 days or less) on a tourist or Schengen visa or visa-free, you won’t get a TIE. Similarly, if you have a student visa for 180 days or less, that visa itself is usually a special stay authorization that does not require a TIE. Also, EU/EEA/Swiss nationals living in Spain don’t get TIEs; they follow a different registration process.
</p>

<p>
The key rule of thumb: Non-EU citizens who intend to reside in Spain beyond 3–6 months must obtain a TIE. The Spanish regulations make this clear, and it’s a nationwide requirement. Even if you think you might not need the card because you have a visa, remember that the visa is only an entry permit. After entry, the visa alone is not a sufficient document for the long term.
</p>

<p>
Also note, children who are non-EU residents need TIE cards too. Babies and toddlers included. Children under 6 don’t need fingerprints, but they still receive a card with their photo and NIE.
</p>

<p>
To recap, if you’re a non-EU national planning to live in Spain, either with a visa from a consulate or an approved permit from Spanish authorities, be prepared to apply for the TIE soon after you get to Spain. It’s a mandatory step for students, employees, freelancers, retirees on non-lucrative visas, family members, asylum seekers with approved status, and everyone in between.
</p>

<p>
If you’re unsure whether your particular status requires a TIE, check the wording of your visa or authorization. If it mentions stays over 90 days or residencia temporal, that’s a clear sign you’ll need a TIE. And when in doubt, Spanish authorities will almost always confirm that you need the card.
